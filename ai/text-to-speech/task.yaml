long_description: |
  Convert text to natural-sounding speech using neural TTS models.

  ## Supported Models
  - Coqui TTS (GPU recommended)
  - Piper (fast, CPU-friendly, offline)
  - Bark (expressive, multi-language)
  - XTTS-v2 (voice cloning)

  ## Features
  - Multi-language support
  - Voice cloning with XTTS-v2 (provide reference audio)
  - Emotion/style control
  - Multiple output formats (WAV, MP3, OGG)
  - Streaming audio output

  ## Performance
  - Piper on CPU: near real-time
  - Coqui/Bark on GPU: 1-10s per sentence
